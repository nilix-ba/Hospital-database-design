## Sample Data

The script includes sample data for departments, employees, patients, pay rates, and more. This data can be used for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Instructions

1. Create a new database called "PROJECT_DB."

2. Uncomment the line `/* drop database PROJECT_DB; */` if you want to drop the database (use with caution).

3. Run the SQL script in your preferred database management system to create the tables and populate them with sample data.

4. You can modify and extend the database schema to suit your specific hospital management system requirements.
